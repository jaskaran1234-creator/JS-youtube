//will do comparison of same datatypes
console.log(2==1)
console.log(2>=1)

//now comparisons of different datatypes\

console.log("2">1)
console.log("01"==1)
//here note that the js is automaticaly converting string data intonumeric number for comparison and is not giving error

//now comparison of null with zero
console.log(null>0)
console.log(null==0)
//above two console statements are false

//but
console.log(null>=0)
//is true because the reason is that an equality check == and comparisons work differently
//comparisons convert null to a number, trating it as zero thats why null>=0 is true and null>0 is false.



//now === which is strict check
//it checks the datatype during equality

console.log("01"===1)
//which is false
// because one is string and the other is number



//SUMMARY
//we have to two types of datatype in JS
// Premitive and reference or non premitive

// Premitive contain : string,number,boolean,null,undefined,symbol,bigint

// Reference : arrays,functions and objects.
